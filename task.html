                <H2>Air India crash: Supreme Court to examine whether probe is being conducted in fair manner</H2>
<p>The Supreme Court of India on Monday agreed to examine whether requisite measures are being taken to ensure a fair, impartial, and expeditious investigation into the June 12 Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad which killed 260 people including 19 on the ground [Safety Matters Foundation v. Union of India and ors].</p>


<p>A Bench of Justices Surya Kant and NK Singh sought the response of the Union Civil Aviation Ministry, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, India (AAIB) and the Director General Of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in the matter.</p>


<P>The Court issued notice on a public interest litigation (PIL) plea filed by Safety Matters Foundation, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) that works towards promoting aviation safety in India.</p>

The Court, however, expressed reservations about the NGO's plea for making all investigation material public, including all recorded fault messages and technical advisories relating to the aircraft in question.</p>
